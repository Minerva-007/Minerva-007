Hi, you came acorss my Github page. This is Mueez-ul-Haq (aka Minerva_007), a mechanical engineer, designer, and programmer. I am currently studying Mechanical Engineering at [UET Lahore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Engineering_and_Technology,_Lahore) and am a self-taught programmer. 

## What I do
My interests in mechanical engineering are:
- Machine design
- Thermofluids
- Modelling and simulation
